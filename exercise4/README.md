## Git Course

### Exercise 4 - Git Merge vs Git Rebase

- create branch ex4 from master
- commit a change in ex4
- commit a change in master
- update ex4 to contain changes from master with merge
- update ex4 to contain changes from master with rebase

Bonus the ex4 and master commits update the same file which will result in conflict. Try to solve the conflict.
